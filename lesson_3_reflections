When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Ideally, when am not sure if I'll have access to my local computer always or if I need to collaborate with other team members.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

As it may introduce changes in code base that effects WIP tasks in my local repository. Hence, making work in-efficient for me.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

Clone is process of copying the git repository from one location to another. Forks is a special case of clone where copying is done from one 
github location to another. Branches is a way to split commits into different buckets, for better organization of work.

Forks are better to use when you want to create a copy of someone else's github repository with your account.
